### Dashboard

##### Surprise!
The dashboard has a surprise in there, but I'm going to spoil it anyway:

> The `p` key maps to `Telescope planets`. 

Of course, there a more useful hotkeys in the dashboard as well. `u` for updating packages with [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), `ff` for `Telescope find_files`, and `mg` for `Telescope live_grep`.

### _oxocarbon_
Wouldn't be complete without [nyoom-engineering](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering)'s [oxocarbon](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon.nvim) theme:
